PROJECT TITLE: The Great Battles
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a fighting game project that represents a battle between 2 people(players). This project aims to demonstrate how to call constructors, accessors, and setters from multiple classes to create a complete game.
VERSION or DATE: 9/24/25
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: When you open the project in BlueJ, you can right-click on the Fighter class to create a fighter using the parameterized constructor. Once you do that, to actually play the game, click on the main class and select void main(Strings[] args) to play. It's interactive for 2 players as well. Each player takes turns choosing if they want to attack or heal, and whoever finishes with no health loses the game.
